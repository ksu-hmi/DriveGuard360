# DriveGuard360: AI-Powered Driver Monitoring System

**DriveGuard360** is an AI-based driver monitoring system designed to enhance road safety by detecting **drowsiness**, potential **stroke symptoms**, and signs of **driver unresponsiveness** in real-time. Leveraging computer vision, physiological signals, and machine learning, this project aims to prevent accidents caused by cognitive or physical impairment while driving.

Features:

- ✅ **Drowsiness Detection** via eye-blink rate, head nodding, yawning, and attention level
- ✅ **Unresponsiveness Monitoring** based on posture, gaze fixation, and physical inactivity
- ✅ **Stroke Symptom Detection** through facial asymmetry, drooping eyelids/mouth, and abnormal motion
- ✅ Real-time **alert system** (audio/visual)
- ✅ Modular architecture for camera, sensor, and model integration

Technologies Used:

-Python	The language your program is written in
-OpenCV	Lets the program “see” with a webcam
-MediaPipe / Dlib	Finds eyes, face, mouth, etc.
-TensorFlow/PyTorch	Runs the AI that detects problems
-Scikit-learn	Learns patterns like blinking or movement
-Flask/Streamlit	Shows alerts and video in a web dashboard
-GPIO/Arduino	Adds real-world alerts like buzzers/lights
