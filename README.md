# DriveGuard360: AI-Powered Driver Monitoring System

**DriveGuard360** is an AI-based driver monitoring system designed to enhance road safety by detecting **drowsiness**, potential **stroke symptoms**, and signs of **driver unresponsiveness** in real-time. Leveraging computer vision, physiological signals, and machine learning, this project aims to prevent accidents caused by cognitive or physical impairment while driving.

Features:

- ✅ **Drowsiness Detection** via eye-blink rate, head nodding, yawning, and attention level
- ✅ **Unresponsiveness Monitoring** based on posture, gaze fixation, and physical inactivity
- ✅ **Stroke Symptom Detection** through facial asymmetry, drooping eyelids/mouth, and abnormal motion
- ✅ Real-time **alert system** (audio/visual)

Purpose: 

- Early detection of medical emergencies: stroke, seizures, diabetic comas

- Security net for long haul truck drivers or overworked first responders


Disclaimer:

This project is for educational purposes only. Do not use as a vehicle safety mechanism or medical safety device.


Future Improvements:

I would like to incorporate smart device integration for vital sign monitoring and real time ECG integration. Once an emergency is detected or activated this data could be shared with first responders within a radius via cloud network as well.
